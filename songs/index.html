					<h2>All For Jesus</h2>
					<div>
						All have treasured charms of beauty<br>
						Clung to golden toys of dust<br>
						Boast in fortune, fame and pleasure<br>
						Only Jesus, we can trust<br>
						<br>
						When our eyes are fixed on Jesus<br>
						Looking at the Crucified<br>
						So enchained by Jesus vision<br>
						We lose sight of all beside<br>
						<br>
						All for Jesus!<br>
						All for Him!<br>
						All my days and all my hours<br>
						Cause he bought me<br>
						<br>
						Oh what wonder! Oh such mercy!<br>
						Liberated from all sin<br>
						Saved from judgement, hell-bound anger<br>
						To live always for our King<br>
						<br>
						All for Jesus!<br>
						All for Him!<br>
						All my days and all my hours<br>
						Cause he bought me<br>
						<br>
						Let our hands move at His bidding<br>
						Let our feet run in His ways<br>
						Let our eyes see only Jesus<br>
						Let our lips speak for His praise<br>
						<br>
						All for Jesus!<br>
						All for Him!<br>
						All my days and all my hours<br>
						Cause he bought me<br>
						<br>
						All for Jesus!<br>
						All for Him!<br>
						All my days and all my hours<br>
						Cause he bought me

					<h2>How Deep the Father's Love</h2>

						How deep the Father's love for us<br>
						How vast beyond all measure<br>
						That he should give his only son<br>
						To make a wretch his treasure<br>
						<br>
						How great the pain of searing loss<br>
						The Father turns his face away<br>
						As wounds which mar the chosen one<br>
						Bring many sons to glory<br>
						<hr>
						Behold the man upon a cross<br>
						My sin upon his shoulders<br>
						Ashamed I hear my mocking voice<br>
						Call out among the scoffers<br>
						<br>
						It was my sin that held him there<br>
						Until it was accomplished<br>
						His dying breath has brought me life<br>
						I know that it is finished<br>
						<hr>
						I will not boast in anything<br>
						No gifts, no power, no wisdom<br>
						But I will boast in Jesus Christ<br>
						His death and resurrection<br>
						<br>
						Why should I gain from his reward?<br>
						I cannot give an answer<br>
						But this I know with all my heart<br>
						His wounds have paid my ransom<br>

						Why should I gain from his reward?<br>
