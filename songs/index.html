					<h2>How Deep the Father's Love</h2>
					<div>
						How deep the Father's love for us<br>
						How vast beyond all measure<br>
						That he should give his only son<br>
						To make a wretch his treasure<br>
						<br>
						How great the pain of searing loss<br>
						The Father turns his face away<br>
						As wounds which mar the chosen one<br>
						Bring many sons to glory<br>
						<hr>
						Behold the man upon a cross<br>
						My sin upon his shoulders<br>
						Ashamed I hear my mocking voice<br>
						Call out among the scoffers<br>
						<br>
						It was my sin that held him there<br>
						Until it was accomplished<br>
						His dying breath has brought me life<br>
						I know that it is finished<br>
						<hr>
						I will not boast in anything<br>
						No gifts, no power, no wisdom<br>
						But I will boast in Jesus Christ<br>
						His death and resurrection<br>
						<br>
						Why should I gain from his reward?<br>
						I cannot give an answer<br>
						But this I know with all my heart<br>
						His wounds have paid my ransom<br>
						<br>
						Why should I gain from his reward?<br>
						I cannot give an answer<br>
						But this I know with all my heart<br>
						His wounds have paid my ransom<br>
