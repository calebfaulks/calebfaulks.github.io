						But Jesus, You paid my debt<br>

						By Your blood, I have redemption and salvation<br>
						Lord, You died that I might reap what You have sown<br>
						And You rose that I might be a new creation<br>
						I am born again by grace and grace alone<br>
						<br>
						I was in darkness all of my life<br>
						I never knew the day from the night<br>
						But Spirit, You made me see<br>
						I swore I knew the way on my own<br>
						Head full of rocks, a heart made of stone<br>
						But Spirit, You moved in me<br>
