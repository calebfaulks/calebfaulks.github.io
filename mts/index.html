				<h2>I'm Doing MTS!</h2>
				<p>MTS is a 2-year full-time ministry apprenticeship program which is all about growing in character, conviction and competency through constantly reading God's word, being thrown into loads of ministry roles and being mentored by a pastor, to ultimately become better equipped in every way for a life of serving Jesus.</p>
				<p>Here's a short explanation by Scott Curtis on MTS and what it will look like for me.</p>

				<h2>Why MTS?</h2>
				<p>There are 3 main reasons I chose to do MTS:</p>
				<p><strong>I live for Jesus' glory.</strong> Over the past few years I have become more and more convicted of this truth. I exist to serve and glorify Jesus, and MTS is a way of doing that with all my time.</p>
				<p><strong>I want to be trained to serve Jesus well.</strong> Serving Jesus is hard. Not just practically, but mentally, emotionally and spiritually. I want to grow in my practical skills, relational skills and dependence on God.</p>
				<p><strong>I trust the MTS program.</strong> For over a decade, Hunter Bible Church has excelled at training apprentices and sending them out into full-time ministry. I have seen the results for myself and have already been experiencing this growth in my own walk with God during my apprenticeship.</p>

				<h2>How You Can Help</h2>
				<p>Programs like MTS can't happen without the support of others, and I would love your support as I head into the next 2 years of serving Jesus.</p>
				<p>Firstly, I would be overjoyed if you would consider <strong>supporting me financially</strong>. I need to raise <strong>$63,000</strong> over the 2 years ($31.5K per year) to cover the costs of my training, my study and my income.</p>
				<p>I would love to encourage you with this opportunity to partner with me in ministry and invest into Jesus' kingdom through me. It truly is a joy to be able to enable, encourage and support full-time ministry, and even a small recurring donation will go a long way to helping me reach my fundraising target.</p>
				<p>If you'd like to give, you can find instructions on how to donate below.</p>
				<p>Secondly, it would mean a lot to me if you could commit to <strong>supporting me in prayer.</strong> I'll need a lot of prayer over the next 2 years as I am thrown into challenging situations and given difficult roles and tasks. I won't get through this in my own strength, so I hope that you will be praying as I will that God will protect, strengthen and grow me.</p>
				<p>If you'd like to pray for me, please sign up for my prayer letter using the form below.</p>
